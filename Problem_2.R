## Homework 4, Problem 2
crime <- read.delim('https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/econometrics2018/data/crime.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(crime)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
## a)
fit <- lm(C ~ HS, data = crime)
summary(fit)
## The estimates show that crime rates increase with the increase in high-school graduates percentage.

## b)
pairs( ~ C + U + I + HS, data = crime)

## c)
fit1 <- lm(C ~ HS + U, data = crime)
summary(fit1)
## There is severe multicolinearity across feature variables which changes the estimates substantially
## This means that one feature variable can be explaine by another feature variable, thus the estimates
## are not incorrect but may not reproduce valid estimates for the change in the explained variable

## d)
## This may somewhat be true according to the model, 
##however we should note that the multicolinearity
## may affect the estimated coefficient values
##There are other variables which influence the crime rate but are omitted in our model.

## e)
fit2 <- lm(C ~ HS + U + I, data = crime)
summary(fit2)
